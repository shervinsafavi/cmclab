  My name is Rezvan Bahmani, recently graduated from University of Tehran in Computer Engineering, currently a research intern at CMC lab under Prof. Safaviâ€™s supervision.

  I am fascinated about Computational Neuroscience, and Machine Learning applications in Cognition. In my point of view, neuroscience is the foundation of many scientific disciplines; Advances in neuroscience will accelerate progress in machine learning, psychology, and many other fields.
