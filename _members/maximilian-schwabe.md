I'm a master student in theoretical biophysics at TUD. My main interest is in statistical physics and dynamical systems theory and how to apply them to understand neural networks. On that note, I'm excited to be working on explaining emergent behavior in an embodied RNN model from a dynamical perspective as my master's thesis.
