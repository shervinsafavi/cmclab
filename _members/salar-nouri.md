Salar Nouri
Research Assistant at CMC Lab

My name is Salar Nouri, and I hold both my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Tehran. I also have industrial experience in data analysis, signal processing, and deploying machine learning models. However, my main research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, mathematics, and neuroscience. I am particularly interested in developing computational (theoretical) models to elucidate the neural dynamics underlying cognition and neural activities, aiming to reveal underlying relationships and representations.
