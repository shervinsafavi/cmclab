I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering (with a focus on Bioelectricity) and have a solid background in the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems. My current research focuses on developing brain-informed deep learning models to explore musical aesthetic judgment and the neural mechanisms underlying how humans perceive music.
