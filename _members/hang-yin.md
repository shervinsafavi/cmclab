I am Hang Yin, a master's student at TU Dresden. My specialization is Computational Modeling and Simulation in Visual Computing. I am currently writing my thesis in the CMC lab, focusing on fusing multimodal neural data and behavioral data using neural networks. I am also interested in investigating the shared patterns of human cognition and behavior through the integration of machine learning and neuroscience.
